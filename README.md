# Hi, I'm Olly! üëã
I've started programming simple games in 2018, further developing my skills with web development in 2020 and recently in 2022 starting my journey with software & back-end development.

# üßë‚Äç Skillset & about me 
## üéÆ Game development
I use GML alongside GMS2 to create 2D games, I have knowledge in A* path finding, state managment, physics simulations and many more topics which prove to be useful in developing games. I also learned Node.js to make multiplayer experiences in which I succeeded pretty early on, it inspired me to learn more and I eventually stumbled upon Javascript which is where my web development journey started. (Yes, I accidentally 
learned Node.js *before* Javascript)

## üåê Web development
I use React due to the way it handles components, it's really simple and results in very readable code, alongside React I usually use Mantine as the component library; however I do like to keep my stack minimal so whenever Mantine is not necessary (eg. in small one-time projects), I find PostCSS to be more than enough.

## üíø Backend development
I've started backend development by learning Firebase to use as a NoSQL database which I used toegether with Node and Express to create RESTful APIs. I've also worked with SQL and MySQL to create full-stack applications, gaining experience in handling server-side data and database design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Software development
I decided to start with Electron as it allowed me to use my front end web development stack seemlessly, after a day of experimenting I've gotten a simple task tracker but I realised how big Electron apps were, with a simple app like that taking upwards of 250mb, I decided to switch to Tauri and after another day I had the same task tracker remade with more functionalities coming in at a whopping 4mb in size. Tauri also forced me to learn Rust, but I dont consider myself a Rust developer just yet due to my inexperience with it.

## Education
I passed my GCSE's with a grade 7 in Maths & It's currently my 2nd year at [Nottingham College](https://www.nottinghamcollege.ac.uk/) where I am studying [Information and Creative Technology Level 2](https://www.nottinghamcollege.ac.uk/courses/information-and-creative-technology-btec-level-1-full-time), with my prior course being [BTEC Vocational Studies Level 1](https://www.nottinghamcollege.ac.uk/courses/progress-to-level-2) in which I served as a Student Representitive & recieved a Pearson Distinction Certificate. My current goal is to continue studying towards the [Extended BTEC Diploma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTEC_Extended_Diploma) which is equalivent to three A2 awards.
