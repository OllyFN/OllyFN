# Hi, I'm Olly! 👋
I've started programming simple games in 2018, further developing my skills with web development in 2020 and recently in 2022 starting my journey with software & back-end development.

# 🧑‍ Skillset & about me
## 🎮 Game development
I use GML alongside GMS2 to create 2D games, I have knowledge in A* path finding, state managment, physics simulations and many more topics which prove to be useful in developing games. I also learned Node.js to make multiplayer experiences in which I succeeded pretty early on, it inspired me to learn more and I eventually stumbled upon Javascript which is where my web development journey started. (Yes, I accidentally learned Node.js *before* Javascript)
## 🌐 Web development
### 🖌️ Frontend
I use React due to the way it handles components, it's really simple and results in very readable code, alongside React I use Mantine as the component library which helps me figure out future steps of projects by creating prototypes in less time than ever (I also have experience in Sass as the style preprocessor but I usually dont need it and find myself using plain CSS or PostCSS instead).
### 💿 Backend
I started out with Firebase as a NoSQL database, it proved to be really easy and it's a really useful tool in my skillset, later on I decided to learn how to make RESTful APIs for my websites using Node & Express which allowed me to process HTTP requests and store server-side data.
## 🛠️ Software development
I decided to start with Electron as it allowed me to use my front end web development stack seemlessly, after a day of experimenting I've gotten a simple task tracker but I realised how big Electron apps were, with a simple app like that taking upwards of 250mb, I decided to switch to Tauri and after another day I had the same task tracker remade with more functionalities coming in at a whopping 4mb in size. Tauri also forced me to learn Rust, but I dont consider myself a Rust developer just yet due to my inexperience with it.

# 📕 Note
This github account is solely created for the reason of showcasing my skillset by making all of the projects on this account be well documented which allows anyone for easy exploration of my past experiences; you can think of it as a portfolio for future work opportunities.
