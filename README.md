# Hi, I'm Olly! 👋
I've started programming simple games in 2018, further developing my skills with web development in 2020 and recently in 2022 starting my journey with software & back-end development.

# 🧑‍ Skillset & about me 
## 🎮 Game development
I use GML alongside GMS2 to create 2D games, I have knowledge in A* path finding, state managment, physics simulations and many more topics which prove to be useful in developing games. I also learned Node.js to make multiplayer experiences in which I succeeded pretty early on, it inspired me to learn more and I eventually stumbled upon Javascript which is where my web development journey started. (Yes, I accidentally 
learned Node.js *before* Javascript)

## 🌐 Web development
I use React due to the way it handles components, it's really simple and results in very readable code, alongside React I usually use Mantine as the component library; however I do like to keep my stack minimal so whenever Mantine is not necessary (eg. in small one-time projects), I find PostCSS to be more than enough.

## 💿 Backend development
I've started backend development by learning Firebase to use as a NoSQL database which I used toegether with Node and Express to create RESTful APIs. I've also worked with SQL and MySQL to create full-stack applications, gaining experience in handling server-side data and database design.

## 🛠️ Software development
I decided to start with Electron as it allowed me to use my front end web development stack seemlessly, after a day of experimenting I've gotten a simple task tracker but I realised how big Electron apps were, with a simple app like that taking upwards of 250mb, I decided to switch to Tauri and after another day I had the same task tracker remade with more functionalities coming in at a whopping 4mb in size. Tauri also forced me to learn Rust, but I dont consider myself a Rust developer just yet due to my inexperience with it.

# 📕 Note
This github account is solely created for the reason of showcasing my skillset by making all of the projects on this account be well documented which allows anyone easy exploration of my past experiences; you can think of it as a portfolio for future work opportunities.
